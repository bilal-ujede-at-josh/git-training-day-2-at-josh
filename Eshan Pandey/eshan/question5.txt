force overwrites a remote branch with your local branch whereas
--force-with-lease is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added to 
the remote branch (by another team-member or coworker or what have you). 
It ensures that we do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.
