Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.


We can set up remote repositories directly from the github->new repository...

We can either manually edit the configuration file for changing the name of origin and include other remote repository's name

OR 

instead of doing it manually we can use these commands: 

git remote set-url origin --push --add <a remote>
git remote set-url origin --push --add <another remote>
