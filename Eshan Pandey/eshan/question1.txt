Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.


Git cherry-pick command is used to pick a particular commit and appended to current working branch....
However, it isn't recommended over merging.



Use cases are :-
1. We want a piece of code directly from a particular known commit, it can be cherrypicked then.
2. To fix a bug in case of quick solution, a SOLUTION COMMIT can easily be cherrypicked.
3. If a branch gets old or pull request isn't responded and expires so one can directly cherrypick from the available commits in logs.


Implementation:

$git checkout master
$git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
