Q4. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it. 

To delete commits use git reset command..

for deleting a commit but not destroying the file in repository and not changing the index, use SOFT RESET.
for deleting a commit as well as all the written code in repository, use HARD RESET.

Command :

git reset --soft <commit-hash> 
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

this <commit-hash> is the hash of the commit till which you want to preserve and post which deletion is required. (multiple commits deleted)


To delete one commit --> git reset <action> HEAD~1
To delete multiple commits upto a point --> git reset <action> <commit-hash>
