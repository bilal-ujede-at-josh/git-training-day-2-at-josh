Q6. How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.
It is possible using two commands :

a) RESTORE -

The git restore command is used when you already added a file to the Staging Area and want to unstage it:
$git restore --staged myFile.py


To discard the local changes in this file along with , you can simply remove the --staged option:
$ git restore myFile.py  (NOTE - $git reset myFile.py does the same thing)
This will discard any local modifications in this file and reset it to its last committed state.

b) RESET -

For unstaging all files at once
$git reset
The staging area will be emptied (but your local changes themselves are left untouched).
