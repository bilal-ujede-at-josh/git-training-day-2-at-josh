Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, 
also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

--> --force-with-lease: 
	Using this flag, git checks if the remote version of the branch is the same as the one 
	you rebase, i.e. did someone push new commits when we were rebasing. The push is then 
	rejected if the remotes branch is changed.
--> --force : 
	One can use --force to ignore the newly added commits on the remote branch and overwrite
	them with the local ones.
