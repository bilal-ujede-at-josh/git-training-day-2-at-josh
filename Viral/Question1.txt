Ques 1: What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.

cherry pick is used for choosing the commit form one branch and applying it to another branch.
it is used for when we do not want to merge the whole branch and you want some of the commits.

Steps to do cherry picking :

1. first create a file test1.txt in main branch. Add it to the git and commit it.
   -->vi test1.txt    //write some text and save it and quit.
   -->git add test1.txt
   -->git commit -m "cherry pick"
2. Now checkout to the new branch test. create a file test.txt, add it, and commit it.
   -->git checkout test
   -->git add test.txt
   -->git commit -m "cherry pick"
3. Now if we do some commit in main branch and we want this change in test branch and we don't want 
   to merge whole branch to the test so we get the commit hash value from the main branch.
   -->git checkout main
   -->git log --oneline
   get the commit hash value
4. now checkout to the test branch and now cherry-pic chnages to the test branch.
   -->git checkout test
   -->git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
