Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. 
you should have a working demo of it.

-->To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal,
in the directory your repository is stored at.

$$ A unique remote name, for example, “my_awesome_new_remote_repo”

$$ A remote URL, which you can find on the Source sub-tab of your Git repo

$$ git remote add remote_repo <git_remote-link>

To push your changes into your remote repo execute the git push <remote> <branch> command:
$$ git push <your_remote_name>
