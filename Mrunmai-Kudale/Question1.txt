Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.
Answer:-
Cherry-picking in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch.
Suppose a developer fails to recognize which branch he is currently on, and by mistake, he commits to 
another branch instead of committing that to the main branch. Now to fix it, he has to first run git show,
then save the commit, then check out the main branch, apply patch there and commit with the same commit 
message. But all this can be done automatically by using just one command i.e. cherry-pick.

Steps :-
1.checkout to the branch from where you want to apply commit 
2.check the log and copy the commit id 
git log -oneline
3.then checkout to the branch where you want to add the add the commit 
4.git cherry-pick commitid 
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "cherry pick message"
