Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you 
have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

Difference:-
force overwrites a remote branch with your local branch.
--force-with-lease is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits 
were added to the remote branch (by another team-member or coworker or what have you). It ensures you do 
not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.

The --force flag is responsible for overriding the protective measures of the remote repository to ensure 
that your changes are forcefully pushed.
Use the --force-with-lease flag instead of the --force flag. If your colleagues change the remote 
repository after your last pull request, this flag will raise an error to prevent you from overwriting
the new commits
