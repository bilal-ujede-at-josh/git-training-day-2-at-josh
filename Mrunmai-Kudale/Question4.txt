Q4. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently. Write command for it. 

If your changes have not been pushed yet simply enter the command 
git reset --hard HEAD~1

If you'd like to delete the commits up until a specific commit, running <git log> into the command line 
to find the specific commit id and then running
git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>

Alternatively, if you have already pushed your changes you will need to run the following code
git push origin HEAD --force
