Q6. How to unstage changes from the staged area. write command for it.

The easiest way to unstage files on Git is to use the “git reset” command and specify the file you want
to unstage.
git reset <commit> -- <path>

To unstage all files, use the “git reset” command without specifying any files or paths.
$ git reset

If you want to unstage your last commit, you can the “HEAD” notation in order to revert it easily.
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

git restore --staged filename
