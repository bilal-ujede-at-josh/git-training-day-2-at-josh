Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. You should have a 
working demo of it.

A developer may need to use multiple Git repositories where the codebase is too big and hence cannot be 
maintained from one single repository. That’s why it is necessary to use multiple Git repositories.
Another big benefit that comes with using multiple repositories is that it can make teamwork efficient 
without the need to depend on each other. This means that they can work independently and work faster than
ever.

When you have one single repository, it is called “origin” by default. If we have two or more remote 
repositories then we should name each of them using unique(!) names.

#Syntax to add a git remote
git remote add REMOTE-ID REMOTE-URL

# Add remote 1: GitHub.
git remote add origin git@github.com:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git
# Add remote 2: BitBucket.
git remote add upstream git@bitbucket.org:jigarius/toggl2redmine.git
