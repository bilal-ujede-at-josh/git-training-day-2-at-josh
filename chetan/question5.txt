Git push

--force
  This option replaces remote version of the branch with our local version of branch.
  Hence, overwriting possible changes made by co-workers.

--force-with-lease
  This option checks if there are commits based on the branch we want to force push.
  If a co-worker based their work on the branch, force push will fail.
  Hence, avoiding accidental overwriting of 


Case 1:
  --force-with-lease will fail in this case.
  --foce can be used if commits E and F are not useful.
