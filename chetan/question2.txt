A new remote repository can be added by the following command

$ git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>

To list connected remote repositories

$ git remote
$ git remote -v  # For verbose information

Use Case:

Multiple remote repositories are usefull to push and pull project source code in different deployment environments.
We can set up one remote for each environment (staging, testing, production).
