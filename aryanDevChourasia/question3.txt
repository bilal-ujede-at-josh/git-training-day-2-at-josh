Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different 
commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 

'Rebase' command can be used to combine different commits into one.

git rebase -i HEAD~N
N here indicates the number of commits to join.

At first we start an interactive rebase session using the above command.

After the above command executes, the editor will pop up, showing the list of commits
we want to merge. Commits are displayed in reverse order.

Mark the commits as squashable by changing the word 'pick' into 'squash' or 's'.

Save the file and close the editor. (Esc, :wq!)

Now create a new commit which represents all the combined commits, the editor will pop up
again with a default message, made of the names of all the commits we have squashed.

Save the changes if made any and exit the editor.
