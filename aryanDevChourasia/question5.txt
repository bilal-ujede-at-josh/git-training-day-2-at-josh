Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, 
also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

Git normally only allow us to push our changes if we have previously updated our local branch
with the latest commits from its remote counterpart. Only when we are up-to-date will we be able to 
push our own new commits to the remote.
The --force option for git push allows us to override this rule: the commit history on the remote will 
be forcefully overwritten with our own local history.
Git push function with --force implies that your local commits become the remote latest commits. 
The downside of this approach is that you will not have records or work from other collaborators


An Safer way to push combined commits:

git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD

--force-with-lease is considered a safer option that will not overwrite the work done on the remote 
branch in case more commits were attached to it (for instance, by another developer). Moreover, it 
helps you to avoid overwriting another developer's work by force pushing.
