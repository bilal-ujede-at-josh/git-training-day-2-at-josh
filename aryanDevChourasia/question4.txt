Q4. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it. 

Deleting the latest commits:
The git reset command is used for deleting the latest commits in Git.

Deleting the most recent commit:
-To delete the most recent commit, run the command below
  git reset --hard HEAD~1

>HEAD~1 means one commit prior to the HEAD.

Deleting multiple latest commits
-To delete the N-th latest commits, you should use HEAD~N as the argument of git reset.
  git reset --hard HEAD~N

-We can also select the appropriate commit by its hash instead of HEAD~N.
  git reset --hard <sha1-commit-hash>
