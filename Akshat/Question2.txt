It is possible to set multiple remote repositories for the same project in Git. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as:

You are working on a project with other developers and want to push your changes to a remote repository that is shared among all the developers.
You want to create a backup of your repository by pushing to a secondary remote repository.
You are working on a project that has multiple upstream repositories and you want to sync your local repository with all of them.


git remote add upstream <URL of remote repository>
