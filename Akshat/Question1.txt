Git Cherry Pick 

Cherry pick allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another branch in Git
Cherry pick is different from merging, as it does not create a new commit.

To cherry pick a commit, use the git cherry-pick <commit-hash> command
If the cherry pick conflicts with changes in the target branch, you will need to resolve the conflicts before the cherry pick can be completed.
