How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project?
ans:

 To set up multiple remote repositories for the same project, you can use the git remote command:
 1)Navigate to your local project directory and initialize a new Git repository if you haven't already.
 2)Add the first remote repository as a remote for your project:
      git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo1.git
 3)Push your local changes to the first remote repository:
      git push -u origin master
 4)Add the second remote repository as another remote for your project:
      git remote add backup https://github.com/user/repo2.git
 5)Push your local changes to the second remote repository:
      git push -u backup master
Now you have two remote repositories set up for your project: origin and backup. You can push to and pull from either repository as needed.


Use case:
   1) One use case for having multiple remote repositories for the same project is to have a backup in case something goes wrong with one of the repositories. 
   2) For example, you might have one repository hosted on GitHub and another hosted on a private server. 
    This way, you have a backup of your code in case one of the servers goes down or has other issues.
