 How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it?

  1) To unstage changes from the staging area, use the git reset command followed by the file name. For example:
         git reset <file>
  2)This will remove the file from the staging area, but leave the file unchanged in your working directory. 
     If you want to undo both the staging and the modification, you can use the git restore command, like this:
         git restore --staged <file>
  3)This will unstage the file and also revert the file to the version in the latest commit.
     Alternatively, if you want to unstage all changes that are currently staged, you can use the git reset command with no arguments, like this:
         git reset
This will unstage all changes that are currently staged. The changes will still be present in your working directory and can be recommitted.
