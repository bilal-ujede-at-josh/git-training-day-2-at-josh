--force 
It overwrites a remote branch with your local branch.
--force-with-lease
It is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch 
(by another team-member or coworker or what have you). It ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.
