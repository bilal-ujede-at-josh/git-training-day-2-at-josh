cherry-pick

It helps to bring a specific commit from one branch to another . It enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD .
It is helpful in case a commit is accidently made to the wrong branch then with help of cherry-pick the commit can be switched to the correct branch.
It is also helpful in team collaboration and undoing changes and restoring lost commits.

Steps
first we find the commit id for the commit we want to change from git log. 
next we checkout to the branch where we want to change the commit to.
then by running $ git cherry-pick commit_it we can achieve the desired result.
