Steps to merge multiple commits 
1. Running git rebase in interactive mode
      git rebase -i HEAD~4 
   here number 4 denotes the total no of commit we want to see in rebase.
2. Typing "squash"
       we will replace pick with squash for commits we want to merge and save the file.
         pick c1
         pick c2
         squash c3
         pick c4
