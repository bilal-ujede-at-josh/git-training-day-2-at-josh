To set multiple repositeries for the same project the following command can be used git remote add <name of remote repository> <url of remote repo>
Using multiple repositories is the only way to work efficiently. 
This enables each team to work independently, and do their work faster. 
You can also make sure that developers only have access to the repositories they need access to (thus making Git more secure.)
